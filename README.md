# BioTENNs: Swarm-Inspired Temporal Event-Based Intelligence for BrainChip

## Project Summary
**BioTENNs** is a biologically-inspired simulation that merges BrainChip’s cutting-edge **TENNs (Temporal Event-based Neural Networks)** with **swarm intelligence** principles. This project simulates a decentralized system of edge agents that process streaming temporal signals and communicate locally using "pheromone" scores to coordinate responses — inspired by ant colonies.

It demonstrates how **intelligent, low-power collaboration** between edge nodes can be achieved using **TENNs-style event detection** and **adaptive, nature-based logic**, aligning perfectly with BrainChip’s mission of enabling real-time AI at the Edge.

## Why This Is Important for BrainChip

- **Extends Akida + TENNs** into a **multi-agent distributed AI framework**  
- Enables **scalable, adaptive behavior at the Edge** with ultra-low power  
- Shows how **lightweight collaboration** can outperform centralized logic  
- Bridges **neuromorphic design** with **biological swarm coordination**  
- Targets real-world applications like:
- Health and bio-signal monitoring (ECG, audio, vitals)
- Wildlife or environmental sensor swarms
- Distributed surveillance with camera nodes
- Swarm robotics (drones, warehouse bots)
- Smart cities and embedded intelligence

## Key Features

- Grid of virtual Edge agents (5x5) simulating temporal sensors  
- Each agent detects spike-based events in 1D streaming data  
- Agents reinforce local events using **pheromone-style signaling**  
- Memory-aware agents boost persistence for repeated signals  
- Variable input streams simulate real-world sensor drift  
- Visual overlays of spike events and pheromone spread  
- Bio-inspired, TENNs-aligned, and neuromorphic-ready

## Nature Meets Neuromorphic

Just like ants coordinate behavior using pheromones, **BioTENNs** enables edge devices to "talk" using minimal, low-power signals. It shows how **nature’s efficiency** can inspire the next generation of **BrainChip-powered edge AI platforms**.

> This is not just a simulation — it’s a vision for intelligent, adaptive, cooperative AI at the Edge, built for a trillion-device future.
